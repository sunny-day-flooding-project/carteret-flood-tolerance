                        <p>Chronic coastal flooding, also known as "high-tide flooding" or "sunny day flooding," occurs without major events like hurricanes.<sup><a href="#refs">1</a></sup>
                            Often seen as a minor issue, it can disrupt daily life, lead to economic losses, and damage property.<sup><a href="#refs">2, 3</a></sup> </p>
                        <p>To understand how chronic coastal flooding affects rural communities, researchers in the <a href="https://tarheels.live/sunny/" target="_blank" title="A joint research effort between researchers at NC State Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering and UNC Chapel Hill Department of City and Regional Planning">Sunny Day Flooding Project</a> are studying a group of communities in eastern Carteret County, North Carolina.</p>
                        <p>We installed five flooding sensors in Carteret County. Four are in a region called Down East (North River Bridge, Davis, Sea Level, and Cedar Island). One is in Beaufort on Front Street. These sensors capture steret conditions and water levels. We've used them to measure the number of days roads were impacted by chronic coastal flooding.</p>
                        <p>In June and July 2024, we interviewed people about chronic coastal flooding. We asked how they cope at home, work, and in their communities. Our interviews included residents and professionals from education, agriculture, parks, public safety, and utilities.</p>
                        <p>We found that: (1) chronic coastal flooding is now impacting communities, (2) people can tolerate more flooding, and (3) flood tolerance is more sensitive to flood frequency than depth. Also, (4) tolerating flooding is tied to strong desires to stay in place.</p>

                        <p>We also asked people about their future flooding tolerance. <b>Flooding tolerance</b> is how much flooding someone can accept before acting.<sup><a href="#refs">5</a></sup> Early results show residents believe their current measures are enough for deeper floods. However, more frequent flooding would be a problem.</p>
                        <p>Many residents felt their high-clearance vehicles, elevated homes, and rural living would protect them from floods of about a foot deep. But, if floods happened more often &mdash; weekly for some, monthly for others &mdash; they would need to rethink their plans or move.</p>
                        <p>Chronic coastal flooding might be causing some to move, but we only found one example. Family factors also played a role. Most others, however, said flooding didn't affect their decision to stay or leave.</p>

                        <p>We found that our respondents showed a strong preference to stay put, linked to their tolerance for flooding. This <b>voluntary immobility</b> means choosing to remain in one's current home or job, yet it often gets overlooked in studies.<sup><a href="#refs">6</a></sup> Many residents expressed a desire to die in their current homes. Living with family and friends on ancestral land shows a strong commitment to facing flooding challenges.</p>
                        <p>Economic trends also affect flooding tolerance and the choice to stay. As job opportunities decline, more people are commuting to bigger cities, increasing their exposure to flooded roads. The focus on building coastal vacation homes makes it tough for young adults in rural areas. They struggle to build affordable, flood-resistant homes suitable for raising families.</p>
                        <p>Social and demographic trends affect people's ability to tolerate flooding and stay in their homes. The population is aging as young people leave for jobs or can't afford housing. Some older residents say they might have to move for better care, as local services are lacking. Without care that involves different age groups, enduring flooding becomes harder for many.</p>
